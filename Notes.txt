Notes:
- Use networkx to find valid cycles coming from 0 and hard code them 
- Need a function to evaluate rankings for the cycles when we are at 0 -> pursue the one that returns the highest value 

Basic Pseudocode: 
- When at 0 node: 
	- Generate rankings for all of the cycles. Pick the highest ranking cycle. This becomes the next path. 
- For each node on the path, switch your stance to fight the opponent on that node. 
	- If there is no opponent on the node, simply switch to strongest stance (or figure out a better rule for idling, idk) 
-  After 300 turns, switch to dueling
